# In_A_Heartbeat_Project
Connecting Arduino's Light Sensor with Supercollider

This project was presented in the forest of Mon Repo, Corfu, at the World Environment Day, 22/6/5. 

This project is a drawing of nature "sensitive" to light. Half of it is beautiful and the other half is destroyed. Adjusting an Arduino circuit behind the drawing and then connecting it to Supercollider, the project "In a heartbeat", while holding a light-type object, gives you the appropriate sound effect for each situation. What do we prefer? Our nature with many colors or our nature destroyed?

In this repository you will find: 

1. The Supercollider document (.scd) used at the World Environment Day, 22/6/5. 

2. The Arduino's circuit source code for reading and printing the light sensor's data.

3. This README file. Link to a youtube video of the project's testing: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/BA71W2jvxu4
